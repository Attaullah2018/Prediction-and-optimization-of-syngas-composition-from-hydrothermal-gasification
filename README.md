# Prediction-and-optimization-of-syngas-composition-from-hydrothermal-gasification
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have witnessed a profound interest and application in the domain of waste to energy. 
However, their black-box nature renders challenges for ubiquitous acceptance. To address this issue, we developed a novel and first-of-its-kind hybrid data-driven and mechanistic modelling approach for hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of wet waste, in which a gradient boost regressor (GBR) integrated optimization model was developed to predict and optimize the yield of syngas from HTG of wet waste
