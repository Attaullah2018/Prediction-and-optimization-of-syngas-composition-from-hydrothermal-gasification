# Prediction-and-optimization-of-syngas-composition-from-hydrothermal-gasification
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have witnessed a profound interest and application in the domain of waste to energy. 
Here, we developed predictive model by employing gradient boost regression (GBR) algorithm to predict, interpretate, and optimize the yield of syngas yield from hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of wet waste.
